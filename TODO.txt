TODO:

ContentInfo: edited
Link: clicked, hidden, media, media_embed, link_created
Comment: comment_created
Similar fields in other datatypes are missing too
Distintion should be improved
"More" objects are not extracted
Options are missing in LinkWithComment
Options are missing in GetLinkListing
Non-informative interactions should have a better return type than plain Values
GetSubreddit's input should be checked and compared with Subreddit's output and GetListing: it's not sure that they match

Posting functionality missing: only comments can be added
Implement rest of the API

Strings should be avoided
LinkWithComment's interpretR needs to be written more clearly
